CV in Terminal interface
==

This is an simple experiment to create a terminal interface of your CV. The commplete application is developed on MVC pattern using BackboneJS MV* model. I have also used Requirejs to add dependency management to the application so that it can load templates and modules dynamically.

Here are the list of Open source frameworks and tooling I have used

- BackboneJS
- RequireJS
- Yeoman for build system
- Mocha
- SASS / Compass

Each command is a module on its own and its very simple to write more modules. I will more documentation very soon.


## TODO 
- Write few more useful modules and command
- Write a grunt task to precompile all template file during build proccess to reduce the latency in the loading and reandering of the view
- I need to write proper documentation on usage of the code.
